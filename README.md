Egoism:
Ethical egoism is the belief that people should follow their own self-interest and that no one has any duty to promote the interests of others. Thus, it is a normative or prescriptive theory, concerned with how individuals should behave. Egoism was contributed by Adam Smith, which had its main focus on the aspects of Individual desires or interests. The main rule which stemmed from this particular concept was the maximization of desires or self-interest.
