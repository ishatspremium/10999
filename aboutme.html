      <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is Monzoor Elahi Mohammed Abdullah Ishat, and I study at North South University and I’m from BBA department. I take residence in Bashundhara R/A. I shall now proceed to notify you of my hobbies. I am quite invested and attracted to Football and Music. My favourite football player is the retired Brazilian former FC Barcelona midfielder, Ronaldinho. I like him quite a lot because of his non-selfish playing style where he is a stylish artist, dribbling through defenders and setting up goals for the attackers. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">His playstyle is quite intriguing to be honest, as we do not see many players similar to him anymore, yet I am still a big fan of La Liga, the league in which FC Barcelona and Real Madrid play in. Now as I mentioned that my other hobby is music, I really like Hindi, English,Urdu, and Bollywood culture songs. Their tone and lyrics are very diversified, expansive, and profound form songs that will truly touch the bottom of your heart with relatable lyrics. My favourite singer is Krishnakumar Kunnath, also known as KK. He has a big ballad of songs, each excruciatingly made to help you reminisce your old memories, ranging from love songs to songs about friendship. He is in my opinion, perhaps the most underrated singer ever. I am so dedicated to him, I have even made a multitude of pages showing his songs and just appreciating him. I have a very nice and loving nuclear family, consisting of my little brother, Aswat, and my caring parents. I adore my little brother, and we both like to watch movies and play videogames with each other, so we have a healthy relationship. I spend a lot of time with my family at dinners and they trust me to go out to my friends’ houses, which I highly appreciate and am grateful for. They have provided me my own life, which no doubt, I can never repay them for. My gratitude and love for them is eternal, as is their love and care for me. I aspire to be a prosperous businessman when I am more matured and prepared to face the world and certainly be able to make a accomplished name and company after I complete my degree. A most memorable day in my life was around two years ago. As I mentioned Krishnakumar Kunnath in an earlier paragraph, I actually got the chance to meet him. I was in India with my family, having our delicious dinner when a picked out a flyer on the wall that showed tickets for a concert, quite perfectly a KK one. After returning to our hotel I scrambled to get onto the Wi-Fi, to quickly check the prices and venue and notified my parents of it. They were very supporting and let me go out with my little brother as we headed to the destination. I found out that we had enough money for the special tickets to meet KK. I thoroughly enjoyed the concert and was absolutely stoked to meet my favourite singer. I found that I was the only one who bought the special tickets, giving me extra time to meet my idol. I was absolutely petrified to meet him, and I managed to get out a few words. I asked him to sign my own entire collections of KK’s works released that year, which he gleefully did and I felt absolutely splendid as he confessed to me his ideas from which he made his songs, which he humbly requested not to reveal to anyone, and I shall satisfy his promise. After around half an hour, I was notified that the event was closing and politely asked to leave. I took out my phone camera and took a selfie with KK and left quite satisfied.</span></p>
